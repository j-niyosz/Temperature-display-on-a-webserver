# Temperature-display-on-a-webseve
For this project you will find a :
## ping pong code's file : 
This code use a RX-TX connexion to transfert the information from the arduino UNO to the ESP8266. Unfortunatlly the transmission between the two ships doesn't work. We do not know how to resolve the probleme. If someone has an idea you are welcome.
## Code fonctionnels :
This file contains the separate code for the webserver and the temperature measurement. You will find videos  showing the result on computer for each code 
## Code softserial :
Because we had problems with the RX-TX connexion we tried a softserial connexion. But we encounter the same probleme it's seems that the transmission of data is done through the TX of the arduino UNO and not the pin we considered for the serial. You will find pictures of the data tram seen on oscilloscpe.
